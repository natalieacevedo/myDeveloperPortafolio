> This is my personal website, I created it with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I chose not to use react and bootstrap for this project since I wanted to practice my vanilla JavaScript and CSS skills. Also this is not a web application is a simple static site.
> I am not using any libraries or packages.
