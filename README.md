> This is my personal website, I created it with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 
I chose not to use React and bootstrap for this project since I wanted to practice my vanilla JavaScript and CSS skills.
 Also because this is not a web application. It is a simple static site. 
 I am not using any libraries or packages.
 
In retrospect, I regret not having designed the website for mobile first.
