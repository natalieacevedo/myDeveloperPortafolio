 <p>Hello there, thanks for visiting! ðŸ™‚</p>
     
   <p> I am Natalie, a web developer with a passion for making the web a beautiful and functional place.</p>

 <p>I started my journey as a programmer in 2019 by learning the holy trinity of web development: HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

 <p>Coming from a non-technical background, I was amazed by even simple acts such as a <span class="mono">console.log()</span> or a font changing color. </p> 
 <p>Since then, I have not stopped learning; it has not always been an easy ride, but I am determined to the best developer I can! </p>
            </p>

        <h2>My Journey as a Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m not a conventional candidate for becoming a web developer. I went down a humanities route, (anthropology), and I have no computer science background. <br><br>
            For almost seven years I moved up different roles, from hotel sales representative to projects coordinator. I enjoyed my work but was not fulfilled by my career choice.<br><br>

            Around three years ago, it was almost by accident, I started learning CSS by reading a book my brother, who is a web designer, left behind in my house. I had recently moved from California to Spain and wanted a career change.<br><br>

           
            I found this book so interesting; that while reading went online to look for exercises to practice. The author of the book recommended Codecademy, while I discover a FreeCodeCamp recommendation somewhere in Reddit.<br><br>
            
            I liked the structure of their curriculum. it was light enough for anyone without a programming background. On the other hand, the basic courses were not very realistic, as they held my hand at all times, they were good enought to start, but of course real-life programming is seldom like that.<br><br>
        
            I spent a lot of my time properly learning the foundations:  CSS, HTML, and Javascript, especially Javascript; because even when using the fanciest frameworks or libraries, in the end, the World Wide Web is built on top of these technologies.
            <br><br>
            When things started to get rough, I had a lot of doubts and was afraid I wouldn't be able to learn to program;  But as time passed, the process of getting stuck and trying to find the solution in different ways became second nature to me.
            <br><br> I got used to feeling uncomfortable, I worked hard and persevered. 
            

There was a moment I felt I wanted to have a more structure and demanding path, that is the reason I decided to join a coding boot camp.
 Having a solid foundation of programming enabled me to reap the benefits of it; otherwise I donâ€™t think I could have been able to retain so much information in such little time, only five months.
<br><br>Overall it was a wonderful experience,  the thing I appreciate the most about it was learning how to work with others, sharing our code in Github, meeting people with the same love for programming, having deadlines, and working with clients using the Agile methodology.<br><br>

I am currently very happy to have a career Iâ€™m passionate about. I intend to keep practicing my craft until I become an excellent programmer. <br><br>

Thanks for reading about my journey, I hope we get to talk a little more about my skills and goals as a developer!
