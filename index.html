 <p>Hello there, thanks for visiting! ðŸ™‚</p>
     
   <p> I am Natalie, a web developer with a passion for making the web a beautiful and functional place.</p>

 <p>I started my journey as a programmer in 2019 by learning the holy trinity of web development: HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

 <p>Coming from a non-technical background, I was amazed by even simple acts such as a <span class="mono">console.log()</span> or a font changing color. </p> 
 <p>Since then, I have not stopped learning; it has not always been an easy ride, but I am determined to the best developer I can! </p>

        <h2>My Journey as a Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m not a conventional candidate for becoming a web developer. I went down a humanities route (anthropology), and I have no computer science background. <br><br>
            Over the course of almost seven years, I have held various roles, from hotel sales representative to project coordinator. I enjoyed my work, but I was not fulfilled by my career choice.
            <br><br>

            About three years ago, almost by accident, I began learning CSS while reading a book my brother, who is a web designer, left in my house. Having recently moved from California to Spain, I was looking for a change in my career.<br><br>

            The book was so fascinating to me, that while reading, I searched online  for exercises for practicing. Throughout the book, the author recommended Codecademy, while I found FreeCodeCamp recommendations on Reddit.
           <br><br>
            
           Their curriculum was well-structured. It was light enough that anyone without programming experience could use it. However, the basic courses were not very realistic, as they held my hand every step of the way. They were good enough to start, but real-life programming rarely works that way.<br><br>
        
           I spent a lot of time learning the foundations: CSS, HTML, and Javascript, especially Javascript, because even if you use the fanciest frameworks or libraries, the World Wide Web was built upon these technologies.
            <br><br>
            As things got tough, I had a lot of doubts and feared I couldn't learn to program; but as time passed, getting stuck and trying to find solutions in different ways became second nature to me.
            <br><br> I got used to feeling uncomfortable, I worked hard and persevered. 
            

            It was at one point I felt I wanted a more structured and demanding path, so I decided to join a coding boot camp.
            /////aqui me quede!!:
 Having a solid foundation of programming enabled me to reap the benefits of it; otherwise I donâ€™t think I could have been able to retain so much information in such little time, only five months.
<br><br>Overall it was a wonderful experience,  the thing I appreciate the most about it was learning how to work with others, sharing our code in Github, meeting people with the same love for programming, having deadlines, and working with clients using the Agile methodology.<br><br>

I am currently very happy to have a career Iâ€™m passionate about. I intend to keep practicing my craft until I become an excellent programmer. <br><br>

Thanks for reading about my journey, I hope we get to talk a little more about my skills and goals as a developer!

 Our goal with this project was to practice all the features of react. When you come from a background of working with vanilla Javascript, developing a "react-mindset" takes practice. This project enabled us to do that effectively.<br>
 Most of the App's functionality and architecture were developed by me. Vanilla CSS and Bootstrap were implemented for the styling.<br>



The idea behind the application is to have a website where a user can type in whatever ingredients are in their fridge. In return, the application will give them a list of recipes based on their input. <br>
In addition, he's given a list of the ingredients that are missing for the recipe, along with a link to where to buy them.

Users can also save their favorite recipes in the browser's local storage for later reference.

Together with four other developers, I created an app where the host of a party, usually a children's one, can share with guests what the child wants as a gift; therefore, it can be a more meaningful present for the child.

 We fell in love with the idea instantly, I hate to see all the waste of resources of the toy industry, the most plastic intensive industry in the world. <br>
 Using MySQL and Node.JS on the back end, and React, Bootstrap and SASS on the front end, we created a beautiful MVP.<br>

                    As part of a company's hiring process, I completed a personality test in three days.<br>
                    React.Js and SASS were used to make this small application. <br>

                    It follows a flow whereby the user changes the application's state by pressing buttons.<br>
                     I did not see a need to use React Router because the inner pages depend on the main state.
                    Users are required to start on the main page. I also did not use any libraries.<br>
                    Although the project is very small, it shows that the developer really understands how the data flows and how state management works in React.<br>
                    Disclaimer: I am not a real psychoanalyst, this is only a toy app with fake logic and data, the logic on the results is completely made up &#128521.
